scoreFollowsAudio
=================

a JavaScript library for time based measure highlighting in rendered MEI (http://www.music.encoding.org) and facsimile page turning (loading images). The implementation requires a JSON file with the corresponding measure parameters as e.g. in Weber_Freischuetz-06_annoMeasures.json

this repository implements the "Gitflow" branching model as described at:
